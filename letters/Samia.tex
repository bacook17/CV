\noindent We have recently signed a lease on a new apartment, which begins on
July 1st. We will be vacating 10 Allston St, Apartment 1, no later than July
14th, and give Samia Companies permission to enter after that date as desired
for repairs or any other purposes.

\noindent As stated by email on Tuesday May 14th, we would like to request that
The Samia Companies make the apartment available for new tenants to take over a
new lease beginning on August 1st, or even as early as July 15th. We would
additionally like to request any fees involved be waived.
We have loved living
here for the past three years, and have taken care of the apartment as we would our own
home. We hope our solid track record as tenants and considerable notice we are
giving can be taken into consideration.

Thank you very much,

Benjamin Cook and Shelby Redfield\\
    10 Allston St. Apt 1\\
    Allston, MA 02134
